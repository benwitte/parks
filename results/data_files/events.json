This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.

With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br />\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","start":"2019-09-17 14:00:00","end":"2019-09-17 16:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 17 02:00 PM"},{"title":"Bench Building","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/17/bench-building","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/17/bench-building","description":"<p>Date: September 17, 2019<\/p><p><p><em>Facilitated by Grow to Learn and GreenThumb<\/em><br />\n<br />\nCreate a seating area for socializing and holding meetings in your garden by building some simple benches.

With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br />\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","start":"2019-09-19 14:00:00","end":"2019-09-19 16:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 19 02:00 PM"},{"title":"The Uni Project Presents: Draw NYC","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/19/the-uni-project-presents-draw-nyc","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/19/the-uni-project-presents-draw-nyc","description":"<p>Date: September 19, 2019<\/p><p><p>For four Thursdays this fall, the northwest corner of the park will host Street Lab/The Uni Project&rsquo;s free DRAW NYC program &mdash; an open-air art studio that offers New Yorkers access to fine art materials and gets people drawing and creating together in public.

With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br />\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","start":"2019-09-21 10:00:00","end":"2019-09-21 16:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 21 10:00 AM"},{"title":"Crotona Park 5K New York Unity Race","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/21/crotona-park-5k-new-york-unity-race","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/21/crotona-park-5k-new-york-unity-race","description":"<p>Date: September 21, 2019<\/p><p><p>In the spirit of unity, which can start with good sportsmanship, Crotona Park Running Club, Inc., a Bronx running club and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization will host the second annual <a href=\"http://nyunityrace.com/\">New York Unity Race<\/a>.

How can we connect with nature in a society that continues to give primacy to disposability and mass-consumption? How do we move away from a mindset of scarcity to one of collaboration? How can we be transformed from the egocentric &ldquo;i&rdquo; to the love supreme &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;?  In this work, artist Tattfoo Tan uses participatory prompts, games, and affirmations to engage you in the play of the universe. Let the process begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Staten Island-based artist Tattfoo Tan&rsquo;s practice focuses on issues relating to ecology, sustainability and healthy living. His work is project-based, ephemeral and educational in nature. Tan has exhibited at venues including the Queens Museum of Art, Eugene Lang College at the New School for Liberal Arts, Parsons the New School for Design, the Fashion Institute of Technology, Wave Hill, Macalester College, Ballroom Marfa, Creative Time, Project Row Houses, and the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati. Tan&rsquo;s projects have been presented by the Laundromat Project, the City of New York Department of Cultural Affairs Percent for the Arts program, and the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts program. His work has been published by Gestalten and Thames and Hudson.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tan has been widely recognized for his artistic contributions and service to the community, and is the proud recipient of a proclamation from The City of New York. He is the recipient of grants from Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Art Matters, Joan Mitchell Foundation, the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, and Staten Island Arts.  In 2010, Tan received the annual Award for Excellence in Design by the Public Design Commission of the City of New York for his design and branding of the Super-Graphic on Bronx River Art Center. He currently serves on the Mayor&rsquo;s Citizens&rsquo; Advisory Committee to support the development of a Comprehensive Cultural Plan.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>All exhibits and programs are located in the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art (Buildings C & G).

The performance will occur the afternoon of Saturday, September 21, 2019, close to the autumnal equinox. <\/p>\n\n<p>The work will manifest as 16 performers, mainly from the Uptown community, moving through the park space. The performers will expand and contract together as they pass melodies, passages of text, and the names of loved ones between each other through the park. The work will be in four,  20 minute, iterations with breaks in between. The audience will consist of both those coming directly to see the performance as well as users of the public park space. <\/p>\n\n<p>The audience will be situated within the performers; they will be immersed in the performing elements as they sit or stand on the lawn in the park. The audience will be able to move about freely, to experience the work as they want, with the ability to come and go. The work will be presented in four distinct iterations to allow for the audience to continue to listen to the work or to allow new audience members to arrive as well as giving all performers the opportunity to be the leaders of a performance.<\/p>\n\n<p>The performers themselves will be helping in the creation of the work. Their personal histories will form parts of the materials utilized in the performance. This collaboration will foster a democratizing effect and ideally create a non-hierarchical structure to the work. The performance will be bilingual, in Spanish and English, to better display the polyglot nature of the community. <\/p>\n\n<p>Passages | Pasajes is made possible in part with public funds from Creative Engagement, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and administered by LMCC.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: Dongan Lawn (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","start":"2019-09-21 16:00:00","end":"2019-09-21 18:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"Dongan Lawn (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Art | Theater | Free Summer Theater","coordinates":"40.86334745378500000, -73.93090415000900000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d41a025214bf.jpg","pubDate":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 21 04:00 PM"},{"title":"Arts, Culture & Fun: Hispanic Heritage Month - Ray Mantilla in Concert","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/21/arts-culture-fun-ray-mantilla-in-concert","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/21/arts-culture-fun-ray-mantilla-in-concert","description":"<p>Date: September 21, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join us as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with a Latin Jazz Concert with Ray Mantilla.

With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br />\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","start":"2019-09-24 14:00:00","end":"2019-09-24 16:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 24 02:00 PM"},{"title":"Welcome to the Garden: Making a Sandwich Board Sign","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/24/welcome-to-the-garden-making-a-sandwich-board-sign","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/24/welcome-to-the-garden-making-a-sandwich-board-sign","description":"<p>Date: September 24, 2019<\/p><p><p>In this workshop, we will brainstorm strategies for growing your garden group with community gardeners from around the city.

With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing.

All children must be accompanied by a caregiver at all times.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Imagination Playground <\/strong><br />\nImagination Playground was designed by famed architect David Rockwell and is an interactive, transformable space that prompts children to manipulate their environment and create a play space of their own. With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br />\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","start":"2019-09-28 10:00:00","end":"2019-09-28 16:00:00","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/common_images/events/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:28 EDT","pretty_time":"Sep 28 10:00 AM"},{"title":"Hispanic Heritage Family Day 2019","guid":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/28/hispanic-heritage-family-day-2019","link":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2019/09/28/hispanic-heritage-family-day-2019","description":"<p>Date: September 28, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join NYC Parks Arts, Culture & Fun and the Jazz Foundation of America for the 4th Annual Hispanic Heritage Family Day!
